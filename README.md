## Introduction 

A  markov-text-generator based on  shakespeare's work. Not as shakespearean as I expected initially;)

## Data Source

[Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/100/)

## Example

```python
$ python3 ./generate_text.py shakespeare.txt hamlet 200

>>> """hamlet said i not this conceal his bedfellow worthy
>>>  lord retiring from this reproach suffolk because 
>>>  i think truth what dream on them the fool i lie for your 
>>> highness will sir say remember any man that our 
>>> diet in my father and turns away so the sign of 
>>> happy i protest her name’s a villain here is not brother of your 
>>> faith i had i left him thief i’ll go backward and
>>> borachio i would you cominius the town i learn 
>>> to my virtue of shapes such a great agamemnon fair and 
>>> season’d for he knows is in talk not amaz d the children 
>>> quits you justicers that blind fool and demetrius as thou
